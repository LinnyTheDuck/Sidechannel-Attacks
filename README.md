## To compile:
`javac *.java`

## To run the program:
`java SideChannel <option> > output.txt`

Options are: <br>
0 = Preliminary Test - For different cache line step values <br>
1 = Measure Individual Cache Hits - Configured for the L3 Cache <br>

The values within the program are calibrated for my laptop CPU specifications - see the report for more information
